# MainDevPortfolio-repo

# WELCOME

Hello, it's such a pleasure to know you've come to check out the code for my main front-end webdev portfolio!
Please enjoy going through the different files and judging the code for yourself! Any questions can and should be submitted to me through the site's main form.

# WARNING

The landing page has a cursor tracking animation along the 3D plane, but this function does not necessarily work with mobile devices!

## Bugs (to be fixed next release)
- Animation can be wonky for Projects in mobile viewing, dektop viewing is successful
  - Dang that pesky Projects page, the grid needs some minor adjust for mobile viewing, desktop viewing is successful
